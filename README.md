# RegularPolygon
Regular Polygon is a shape with the 3 or more sides.
Each side must be equal in length. formula for calculating area is different based on the number of sides.
Square area = length of side * length of side;
Triangle = length of side * length of side * sqrt(3) / 4
This console application calculates the area of Square, Triangle and Pentagon with appropriate test cases.
Also it is designed in such a way that in future adding a new regular polygon in the system must be easier and it follows OOD principles.
